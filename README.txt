Norman Extended for Mac OS X
============================

This keyboard layout is based on Norman [1] and the "U.S. Extended" layout that
comes with Mac OS X. The .bundle file was built using Ukelele 2.2.8 [2] and the
.keylayout file modified by switching the key codes in the XML.

The .icns file was created via iconverticons.com [3] and should probably use
a pixel font to make the character look sharp even when resized. (PR welcome)
